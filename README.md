# My Tetris Game

### Rules
- Use mouse or keyboard to move and place tetrominoes onto the board.
- When there is a 3 by 3 or larger region that is all placed with tetrominoes, they are all destroyed and the player gains scores.
- The player comes to the next stage if they place enough tetrominoes, but the tetrominoes remained when level-up can become undestroable with probability.
- The player can buy tool by spending scores they earned to help them.
